<p>wtf my dude</p>
<p>WebRTC aggressively drops audio packets to keep latency low. If you’ve ever heard distorted audio on a conference call, that’s WebRTC baybee. The idea is that conference calls depend on rapid back-and-forth, so pausing to wait for audio is unacceptable.</p>
<p>…but as a user, I would much rather wait an extra 200ms for my slow/expensive prompt to be accurate. After all, I’m paying good money to boil the ocean, and a garbage prompt means a garbage response. It’s not like LLMs are particularly responsive anyway.</p>
<p><strong>But I’m not allowed to wait</strong>. It’s <em>impossible</em> to even retransmit a WebRTC audio packet within a browser; we tried at Discord. The <em>implementation</em> is hard-coded for real-time latency <strong>or else</strong>.</p></blockquote>
